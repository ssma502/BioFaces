# BioFaces
This is the implementation of our paper "Lightweight Dichromatic and Biophysical Models for Face Analysis".
We will shortely provide the citation information if you use our code.

We implemented all models and CNN using MatConvNet with autonn. For the instructions, Please see [the installation page](https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/) 

The easiest way to run the code is to run the mainBioFaces.m script. This loads all models, and then starts trainning the CNN.
